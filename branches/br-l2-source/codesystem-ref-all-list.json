      "description" : "The CDC's National Center of Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD - see [https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/)) developed and maintains the CVX (vaccine administered) code set. It includes both active and inactive vaccines available in the US. CVX codes for inactive vaccines allow transmission of historical immunization records. When a MVX (manufacturer) code is paired with a CVX (vaccine administered) code, the specific trade named vaccine may be indicated. These codes should be used for immunization messages using either HL7 Version 2.3.1 or HL7 Version 2.5.1. CVX is the underlying Master Code System for V2 table 0292 (Vaccines Administered). The machine readable name for CVX in PHIN VADS is PH_VaccinesAdministeredCVX_CDC_NIP. The version of the CVX code set for certification can be found on the archive page:[https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/mu3versioned_codes.asp](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/mu3versioned_codes.asp) \r\n\r\nThe Status column indicates if the vaccine is currently available in the United States.\r\n\r\n*  Active: A currently available administrable vaccine \r\n\r\n*  Inactive: An administrable vaccine formulation that is no longer available for patient administration, but can be found in historical patient records OR A historical record of a vaccine administered where the exact formulation is unknown \r\n\r\n*  Pending: A vaccine that is expected to become active in the future \r\n\r\n*  Non-US: A vaccine that available outside the US only \r\n\r\n*  Never Active: A vaccine that was never available and is not in the pipeline of new vaccines \r\n\r\nThe Last Updated column indicates the last time this particular vaccine code was updated in this table.\r\n\r\nQuestions regarding this table should be directed to the IIS Technical Assistance Team via iisinfo@cdc.gov (or use mailing address via [https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx#addr](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx#addr)) \r\n\r\nHL7 Implementers should note that 'Status' IS NOT CONCEPT STATUS as all codes are ACTIVE in this code system.\r\n\r\nThe current code system is available via [https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=cvx)",

Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.",
