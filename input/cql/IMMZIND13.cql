NOTE: This is an estimated denominator measure, meaning that all we are contributing from the site perspective is a count
towards the numerator, actual processing of this data to determine a proportion measure would be done by downstream analytics

For this reason, this measure is modeled as a cohort measure where membership in the cohort is determine by administration of
a measles containing vaccine.
