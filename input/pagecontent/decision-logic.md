This page describes the decision support logic included in the WHO
Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK): SMART Guidelines for Immunizations (link forthcoming).

The decision-support logic component provides the decision logic and
algorithms, as well as the scheduling of services, in accordance with
WHO guidelines. The decision logic and algorithms in this implementation
guide deconstruct the recommendations within the immunization guidelines
and guidance into a machine readable format that clearly labels the
inputs and outputs that would be operationalized in a digital
decision-support system, such as an electronic immunization registry
(EIR).

### Decision Support Logic Overview
The table below provides an overview of the decision-support tables and
algorithms for the different business processes in an EIR. The structure
of the decision-support tables is based on an adaptation of the Decision
Model and Notation (DMNâ„¢), an industry standard for modelling and
executing decision logic. These decision-support tables detail the
business rules, data inputs and outputs to support EIR business
processes.

<a name="note1"></a> Note 1: Refer to the first note in the CSV data for specifics on the supplementary dose.  
<a name="note2"></a> Note 2: This dose is applicable if the patient is in a setting where there is high transmission of Measles.  
<a name="note3"></a> Note 3: This dose is applicable if the patient is in a setting where there is low transmission of Measles.  
<a name="note4"></a> Note 4: This dose is applicable if immune reconstitution was achieved for the individual following HAART.
