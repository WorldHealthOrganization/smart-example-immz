This page provides an overview of illustrative functional requirements that may be considered to kick-start the process of designing or adapting the immunization information system (IIS) digital tracking and decision-support system.

Functional requirements describe the capabilities the system must have in order to meet the end-usersâ€™ needs and achieve tasks within the business process.

These requirements are taken from Component 8 and Web Annex D of the WHO Digital Adaptation Kit: SMART Guidelines for Immunizations (link forthcoming).

Please note that these are not exhaustive lists and should be modified according to context and user persona needs
